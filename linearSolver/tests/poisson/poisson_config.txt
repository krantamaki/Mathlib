# This is a example configuration file for the linear linearSolver
# The structure of the config file allows for single line comments with '#' character
# Additionally, one needs to define the type of the input as seen below
# Valid types are 'string', 'int', 'float', 'bool'

### Mandatory information

# Path to the coefficient matrix
coef_path = string linearSolver/tests/poisson/linsys_a_ML3.dat
# Path to the right hand side vector
rhs_path = string linearSolver/tests/poisson/linsys_b_ML3.dat
# Path where the solution should be stored
ret_path = string ret.dat

### Optional information

# The method used to find the solution (defaults to cg)
method = string cg
# The verbosity (defaults to 3 i.e. output everything)
verbosity = int 3
# The tolerance to which solution is found (defaults to 1e-7)
convergence_tolerance = float 1e-7

### Unnecessary information

# User can add any information they want, but if it's unnecessary it 
# will end up ignored. Uncomment the line below to observe this
# test_info = bool false
